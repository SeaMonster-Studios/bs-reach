# bs-reach

Reason bindings for [Reach UI](https://reacttraining.com/reach-ui). 

## How to Install

```sh
npm install --save bs-reach
```

Then add it to bsconfig.json:

```js
"bs-dependencies": [
  "bs-reach"
]
```

## Documentation
The [official documentation](https://reacttraining.com/reach-ui) for Reach UI has a lot of great examples and explains the api of the components well. The bindings tries to deviate from the original api:s as little as possible.

Under the `examples` directory there are some examples of how to use these bindings.
